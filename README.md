# Exercise Tracker

* This project is an Exercise Tracker built using FreeCodeCamp's boilerplate for the Exercise Tracker project. The goal of the project is to create a web application that allows users to track their exercises and view their exercise logs.
* I set up the MongoDB database and wrote the index.js backend file for this project based on the boilerplate

## Technologies Used
* Node.js: The backend of the application is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.

* Express.js: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust web applications.

* MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It was used to store user information and exercise logs.

* Mongoose: Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution to model your application data.
